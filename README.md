Randomly samples a high-dimensional space with a set of constraints.

Function sampler.py is called with the following command:
python3 sampler.py <input_file> <output_file> <n_results>

<input_file> is the path to a file that contains a description of the space
and constraints.
<output_file> is a path to where the output should be written
<n_results> is the number of valid points that should be output
